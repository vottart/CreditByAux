## Not all credit is the same
 
Corporate financing is often much more than the pure and classic bank loan. To provide you with the best product for your business, we offer a range of solutions for you:

1. **Loan:** The classic loan can be flexibly adapted to your needs. Start from as little as 10.000â‚¬.
2. **Factoring:** Factoring provides you with short-term liquidity by reselling your invoices.
3. **Leasing:** If you want to buy new machines or cars, leasing is usually the best solution.
4. **Purchase Financing** Purchase financing helps you to save your liquidity when purchasing your goods.
